- [tutorials](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/) are a good place to learn ROS concepts
- [examples](https://github.com/ros2/examples/tree/master/rclcpp) are intended to be somewhat of a template for your application
- [demos](https://github.com/ros2/demos) really drive home key concepts and have intermediate programming (c++) concepts
